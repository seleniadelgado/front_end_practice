form.html
This project is a registration form which incorporates the usage of main form elements.
Here I am using the text input, password input, email input, radio buttons, select tags and a checkbox input. 
This project also includes validations, required for the email and passwords, as well for the checkbox input. 
The password must also have a min length of 8 characters.

For this project, I did not use any Javascript or CSS, this is a purely HTML5 form.
